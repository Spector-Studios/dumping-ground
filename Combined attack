Great — the **global “danger map”** is a super useful quality-of-life feature in tactical games. It lets the player see at a glance which tiles are threatened by enemies, without checking each unit individually. Fire Emblem and similar games use this a lot.

---

## 1. What is the “Danger Map”?

It’s basically:

* For each **enemy unit**, compute all tiles they could attack **on their turn** (movement + weapon range).
* Combine (union) these sets into one big overlay.
* The player can toggle this overlay to see where they’d be in danger if they moved a unit there.

---

## 2. Algorithm

1. Initialize a `HashSet<Position>` (or a `2D grid<bool>` if you prefer).
2. For every **enemy unit**:

   * Run `calculate_attackable_tiles(map, enemy_unit, units)`.
   * Add the results into the danger set.
3. At the end, you have a global set of threatened tiles.

---

## 3. Implementation Sketch

```rust
fn calculate_danger_map(
    map: &Map,
    all_units: &Vec<Unit>,
) -> HashSet<Position> {
    let mut danger = HashSet::new();

    for unit in all_units {
        if unit.faction == Faction::Enemy {
            let attackable = calculate_attackable_tiles(map, unit, all_units);
            danger.extend(attackable);
        }
    }

    danger
}
```

If you want to store it as a **grid** (for quick lookups in rendering/UI):

```rust
fn calculate_danger_grid(
    map: &Map,
    all_units: &Vec<Unit>,
) -> Vec<Vec<bool>> {
    let mut grid = vec![vec![false; map.width]; map.height];

    for unit in all_units {
        if unit.faction == Faction::Enemy {
            let attackable = calculate_attackable_tiles(map, unit, all_units);
            for pos in attackable {
                if map.in_bounds(pos) {
                    grid[pos.y as usize][pos.x as usize] = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    grid
}
```

## 4. Variants / Options

* **Faction-specific danger maps**:
  Instead of just “Enemy threat,” you could compute separate maps for different factions (useful for AI to know where they are threatened by the player, too).

* **Danger values**:
  Instead of `bool`, you can make the map store *how many units threaten that tile*. This lets you display a heatmap (e.g., darker red = more dangerous).

* **Precomputation vs On-demand**:

  * For players, usually recompute when the player toggles “show danger” or when enemy units move.
  * For AI, compute on-demand when deciding actions.

---

## 5. Example Workflow

1. Player toggles “Danger Zones On.”
2. The game runs `calculate_danger_map()` once for all enemies.
3. UI highlights all tiles in red where enemies could attack.
4. Player can now safely plan moves avoiding red zones.

---

✅ With this, you now have:

* Per-unit movement ranges.
* Per-unit attack ranges.
* A global “danger map” from enemy units.

Would you like me to also show how to **optimize performance** (e.g., caching movement costs per terrain type + movement type, avoiding full recalculation every frame)? This can become important on larger maps with many units.
