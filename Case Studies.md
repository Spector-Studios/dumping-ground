Here are **five** field-/application-oriented papers (or case studies) you can use for your presentation on “flow scan imagery” / array production-logging tools (e.g., FloScan Imager, Flow Scanner) in production logging. Each includes a short annotation so you can pick the ones most relevant to your topic.

If you like, I can **gather PDF links** (or DOIs) for each of these and potentially **locate 2-3 more** that are very specific to the brand “Flow Scanner/Flow Scanner system” (from Schlumberger) in field case studies (e.g., Middle East or deepwater wells) to bring your total to, say, **7-8** papers. Would that be helpful?
