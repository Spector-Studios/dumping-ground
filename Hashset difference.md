Yep 👍 — in Rust, if you’re using `std::collections::HashSet`, you can do **set difference** directly.

---

## 1. Using the standard library

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;

let a: HashSet<_> = [1, 2, 3, 4].into_iter().collect();
let b: HashSet<_> = [3, 4, 5].into_iter().collect();

// Non-consuming iterator (borrowed sets)
let diff: HashSet<_> = a.difference(&b).cloned().collect();

println!("{:?}", diff); // {1, 2}
```

* `difference(&b)` returns an **iterator** over values in `a` but not in `b`.
* You usually call `.cloned().collect()` if you want another `HashSet`.
* Cheap: O(|A|) lookups, since `HashSet` lookups are O(1) average.

---

## 2. Consuming / in-place difference

If you want to **mutate** `A` directly (cheaper, no need to allocate a new set):

```rust
let mut a: HashSet<_> = [1, 2, 3, 4].into_iter().collect();
let b: HashSet<_> = [3, 4, 5].into_iter().collect();

a.retain(|x| !b.contains(x));

println!("{:?}", a); // {1, 2}
```

* `retain` goes through `a` and keeps only elements not in `b`.
* This avoids allocating a new set and can be faster if you don’t need the old `a`.

---

## 3. Summary

* `a.difference(&b)` → non-consuming, returns an iterator.
* `a.retain(|x| !b.contains(x))` → in-place, consuming style, no extra allocation.

---

👉 In your movement/attack system, if you want “movement tiles but not danger tiles,” the **retain approach** is probably the cheapest, since you already have a `HashSet` of movement tiles.

Do you want me to also show how you could generalize this to **all set operations** (union, intersection, symmetric difference) efficiently in Rust, or just stick with difference?
